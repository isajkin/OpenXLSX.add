The library is a wrapper for OpenXLSX and provides a user-friendly interface similar to Excel's VBA.
At the first stage, the ability to sequentially install styles without using internal OpenXLSX settings dictionaries was implemented.
A set of commands will also be offered that emulate Excel commands: Insert, Copy, Paste.
Soon we will implement the insertion of a drawing with the ability to set a small set of attributes.
The library is developed using VS 2022 for X86 The OpenXLSX library is built for Multithreaded use (/MT)
